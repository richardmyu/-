"Oh, zero. Customer research. Haha hahaha. No. I mean. I mean, we just made a car that we thought was anwesome. You know, it looks super weird." —— Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc., when asked if Tesla conducted customer research in designing their new vehicle.

There's something peculiar about the psychology of Tesla vehicle owners that runs contrary to every well-accepted theory about how customers are supposed to behave. Our understanding of customer satisfaction is based on decades of research. It relies on data from hundreds of thousands of customers in every conceivable industry(even the IRS and U.S. Postal Service are included).
