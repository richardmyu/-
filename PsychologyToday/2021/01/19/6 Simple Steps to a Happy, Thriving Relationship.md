KEY POINTS

- Healthy relationship functioning is not a mystery: it's defined by well-directed effort.
- Little chages can build the day-to-day habits that define happy relationships
- Relationships are dynamic and can change with effort

Romantic relationships require nurturing, but how do you best nurture an existing relationship?

Part of the problem is that, over time, every relationship develops patterns. Patterns in behaviors, patterns in emotions, patterns in what we expect from our partners(and ourselves). These patterns define our everyday interactions. They might be healthy enough to keep a relationship going, but if you're looking for a relationship to thrive(not just survive) then pointed efforts to enhance your relaitonship patterns could be exactly what the doctor ordered.

How to Help your relationship thrive, not just survive

Relationship scientists strive to identify the patterns that predict healthy relationship functioning. Evidence suggests it worth your time to consider adopting or doubling-down your effort to do the following:

1.**Practice responsiveness**. Responsiveness helps alleviate the potential adverse effects of stress in relationships. We know relationships can stuffer in the face of one or both partners' work stress, family stress, or any other kind of potentially toxic threat from external to the relationship. When people practice responsiveness, they are giving full attention to their partner, really listening and expressing care and concern. This gesture goes a long way in protecting a relationship, including from the stressors tied to the pandemic(Balzarini et al., 2020)

2.**Make your phone an asset, not a liability**. If you've beard of technoference (technology + interference), you're probably familiar with the idea that phones can be problematic in relationships. You've got texts to read, social media sites to check, online shopping to do...but when people are distracted by their phones to the point where they are ignoring their partners, relationship well-being can stuffer. This partner "phubbing"(phone+snubbing) is now well-documented(Roberts & David, 2016)

But did you know phones can be used to improve relationships? Sending positive text message can boost relationship satisfaction (Luo & Tuney, 2015), a simple step that can support the health and wellness of your relationship.

3.**Foster psychological flexibility**. It's easy to rigidly want what you want and make demands, but research suggests that couples —— and families —— do better when people practice psychological flexibility. Being open, aware, considering the context, and keeping perspective all go a long way in reducing negativity(and not escalating problems). Fortunately, psychological flexibility can be developed with practice.
