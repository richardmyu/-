Everyone has different skills and abilities, but everyone gets the exact same amount of hours in a day. That's why time has been doubbed "the ultimate equalizer." So if you really want to get ahead, focusing on time management best practices will be hours well spent.

There are time management "hacks" galore. But i'm not interested in a specific system-everyone is unique and needs something different. Instead, offered below is my interpretation of what the social science research suggests are four overarching, universal best practices in time management.

Before outlining the four practices, it's important to first understand the end goal of time management. Meta-analytic evidence (based on an aggregated study of studies) suggests that the impact of time management on performance is weak at best. So why do it? Because time management is strongly associated with a host of well-being indicators such as stress, job satisfaction, and work-life balance. Time management can help us to remain productive without unnecessary strain.
